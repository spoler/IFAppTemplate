/** A suite of creators and comparators for NSDate.
 
 This category introduces all manner of date initializers,
 comparisons, adjustments, intervals, and decompositions
 for NSDate instances on the minute, day, week, month,
 and year intervals.
 
 For the sake of simplicity rather than exactness, these
 methods use whole integer values rather than real
 numbers; fractions of intervals will not come into
 play. Instead, use the appropriate lesser interval.
